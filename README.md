# 3D-CFD-with-Weissinger-method
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a three-dimensional problem, specifically  focusing on the examination of a finite wing through the numerical implementation of Weissingerâ€™s  method.

The primary objective is to design a finite wing with the goal of minimizing induced drag  while maintaining a fixed angle of attack and ensuring a specified range of values for cL. The presence
 of a tail is also taken into account to reduce the wing pitching moment, both with and without the  ground effect. The methodology has been developed using MATLAB, and its validation has been
 executed through XFLR5.

Here several files are provided and you have three main for getting the results over an entire wing, a tandem configuration and a tandem configuration with ground effect.
